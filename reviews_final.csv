Rakannan,Official site,The concept of using CGM to guide your training and food plan is brilliant. The app is also very well laid out.
Nayanava,Official site,"This has to be the best device after Apple Watch which helps track the blood glucose levels, in turn helping maintain a healthy lifestyle by allowing me make the right food choices while staying away from the others. It has kind of become like a challenge to maintain blood glucose levels below 110 now throughout the day!! I have quit almost all foods that have added sugar."
Athif Hasan,Official site,"Ultrahuman M1 gave me a complete insight the impact every food has to my body. Did not follow any fancy diet, yet managed to educate myself around food, and built a sustainable & healthy lifestyle."
Ranger3010,Official site,Ultrahuman sensors are easy to wear and very effective in diet control. It helps me track my calorie intake and allows me to be in absolute control of my sugar! Highly recommended for people trying to control there sugar and maintain optimal body weight.
Srinath Rajam,Official site,"...is impossible without the ability to control oneâ€™s blood glucose levels. As a nutritionist and a cycling and fitness coach, I stress food as 80% impact on health and CGM is an indispensable tool to help every individual figure out foods to eat/ avoid and in the right quantitiesâ€¦ We all react differently to the same food so eliminating guesswork is an important aspect to overall metabolic health Keep up the great work UH, your supporting data is amazing."
Praneeth Pike,Official site,It’s super rare for me to write a review. And I’m writing this to appreciated that signing up for Ultrahuman is one of the best decisions I’ve made in 2022.The continuous monitoring of glucose levels combined with the insights has made my body feel much better in almost all aspects of my health. I also exercise much better portion control and food choices because of this.
Amar Salvi,Official site,"Understanding how your blood sugar spikes makes a huge difference in bringing it under control. I used to have my meds regularly thinking that my sugar is under control, checking it once in a while. Got the shock of my life recently when my Hb1AC went through the roof.Switching to Ultrahuman made a huge difference in bringing things under control in just two weeks, as I could adjust my meds and see how each intake and active was affecting sugar levels. Recommended!"
Manoj Adithya,Official site,"Love the app, essential for my daily life. Perfect. I should invest in Ultrahuman"
Rajiv Rai,Official site,It’s been a very awesome and most rewarding two weeks on ULTRAHUMAN. I have learnt so much about my own body and what is right and what I need to do to both reduce by HBA1C (which anyways was in the range) and more importantly to increase my metabolic score from high 79’s to over mid 80’s. I am now a much happier and healthy person in just two weeks.However I will not continue wearing one for next 4 months after which I will again get one and wear it for two weeks. So in my mind thrice a year I will wear it for 15 days at a time. I must have induced at least 20 persons to get it and all of them are thanking me for introducing a life changing device to them. This is an excellent wearable and I am ready to even invest in this start-up co of yours. Kudos to you guys.
Sudz328,Official site,"The app is brilliantly designed. Its easy to find the pieces of information you need. there’s so much you can learn through it and my lifestyle and diet have already improved thanks to Ultrahuman.For people who value their health, this is a remarkable product. Lastly the performance coaches are great andhelpful and super prompt."
War Of The Lords,Official site,"I had got this just for a trial basis but then it is so good, my whole family of six wear it. I love how the software is soo good in analysis and in giving knowledge on what’s going on in our body."
Ashish Kole,Official site,"For the past few years, I’ve been trying to understand how my body responds to food, especially sugar (and stuff made from molasses), which I seem to be unable to resist. The Ultrahuman app finally gave me a simple-to-understand view of what happens when I eat or drink almost immediately, when paired with the accompanying Continuous Glucose Monitor. Similarly, while the app has a provision to input what I’ve eaten, it has lots of integration with 3rd party food tracking apps such as MyFitnessPal, which I use to track my food intake. It takes inputs about my movement / exercise from 3rd party devices such as Apple Watch (which I use) or Garmin, Fitbit, Oura, Polar or even Google Fit.There’s a generous community of Ultrahuman users as well as Ultrahuman coaches and developers and who share insights, experiences, challenges and other hacks. All in all, it has been a journey of discovery as I discover new insights using this “lab in my arm”."
AsDelhi123,Official site,With this I get to know what food is having adverse effect on my sugar levels and which type of food keeps my sugar in range ! I have made 3 more family members buy it and we are all very grateful for this technology.
Aiken Crux 99,Official site,"Only if my body could talk and actually tell me what it needs. Or if my brain could interpret. Everyone will live longer and be happier. Ultrahuman fills that gap in the human evolutionary chain. What sets it apart from other CGMs is the high research and performance orientation, love for logic and an inspiring community that this brings. Other’s I have found to be too commercial. I wish this was more cost effective though but I do feel that the ultrahuman team is doing their best.Cant wait for the ring! Bonus - Probably the best health focused content library you will find (And I have been a subscriber to most others before :) All the best to the team"
MindMyWeb,Official site,With Ultrahuman I was able to identify small things I was doing wrong in my day to day life I used it to make a lifestyles program that is giving big results.
Laboosh1,Official site,I’m learning about how good effects my body every day. It doesn’t stop me eating some things I love that spike my insulin but at least I can see how other foods effect that spike.
Bhargav K,Official site,"Hey Cyborg Team, I got my hands on the Ultrahuman Cyborg device as a private beta user entry and trust me there has been no going back. The product is top-notch in tech and explains things unseeable by the human body.Looking forward to grow and learn more about my body with the product.Cheers, Bhargav Super Cyborg"
Mohith4590,Official site,"This app is absolutely essential if you are serious about your food intake. What you may think is good food, may not be best fit for your body and with the help of Ultrahuman you can see that quantified in numbers.The app is easy to use and the insights it provides is life changing. I’m very happy with the experience."
Pushpak (pd),Official site,The sensor and supporting app gives one amazing insight on how one’s body reacts to food intake and how best to manage health. Highly recommend the experience!
Piyk19,Official site,"Really happy with the initial usage of the app and sensor. Giving me very useful insights into my relationship with food, sleep and workouts !!"
Adilohyijnxr,Official site,The real-time feedback the platform gives us just stellar and super powerful
Abdulla0784,Official site,"Deep real time health insights, right from UX to product all perfect to the T!"
Kumar Sumit Gaurav,Official site,"Helped me immensely in knowing what triggers the sugar spike and what lowers it. The backend integration is superb and feedback mechanism is well integrated. Research and fitness module are spot on, helped me reduce weight by almost 6 kgs in just 20 days.A must for all fitness freak and calories caution people. Also good for diabetic people. Calibration did not take longer and it was up and running in 1 hour max. The team must do research for having this application directly sense sugar level."
Raj Thakur,Official site,"This is by far the best app for the insightful data analysis which helps you to track your metabolism, to add on a personal touch by the CEO on email for your motivation is a cherry on cake.The food score, workout fuel score etc are to the point and the interface of the app is brilliant, good job Team Ultrahuman ????"
ParentRaj,Official site,The app brings out some of the key insights required for managing blood glucose effectively. The nudges by the app and the related knowledge are a great features.The slack platform is quite good for learning and growing as a community. Some of the features are still evolving though.
Kanish Singh,FitCart,Best advanced glucose tracker. Ultrahuman Continuous Glucose Monitor has been a game-changer for me.
anuuj punjabi,Flipkart,"Unlocks a dashboard to your body. You're able to monitor your glucose levels from your phone. The goal is optimise your metabolic score that's out of 100. I've noticed when I keep my glucose levels stable, I feel much more energetic. A must buy for someone looking at understanding their food patterns."
Sharad K Upadhyay,Amazon,"Worked wonders. This is amazing. I am now in control of my glucose level, because I can see the levels and the app tells me what could have gone wrong and how can I improve it. This is a blessing ! Thank you."
Ashok A,Amazon,"I bought it and after the first reading when I tried to read the second time the patch started showing your blood sugar level as crashed with a reading of “51”. I was feeling well. Just to be doubly sure I checked my blood level with the pin prick accu. It showed 174. But not wanting to give up on the convenience of the mobile phone reading wanted to give Ultrahuman a fair chance. Also their WhatsApp support told me that usually such reading become good after a day or so. Tried for many hours and the next day, fully frustrated, removed it to send it back for refund. After many frustrating days of complaints with many people and satisfying them with proofs like photograph of the readings, etc. they refused to give the refund. TL;DR - Avoid UltraHuman. It is a big scam with people who are running the scam having no understanding of what customer service is."
Moiz,Amazon,"The user interface of the app is fantastic and provides precise results. Initially, it requires a 24-hour calibration period. After this, I noticed some discrepancies in accuracy, so I contacted customer support. Impressively, they responded within an hour and provided a Glucometer to verify the app's readings. After recalibration, the app's accuracy improved significantly.I'm also a user of the Ultrahuman air ring, and I appreciate how seamlessly it integrates with the app, offering comprehensive data analysis.The app is proactive in its reminders, prompting scans in the morning and periodically throughout the day. It's particularly useful after meals, suggesting short walks and other actions if a glucose spike is detected.This tool has been instrumental in understanding my glucose levels and how different meals affect them, allowing me to make informed dietary adjustments.I even got one for my wife, and she's equally impressed.Overall, this product is my go-to choice and has my full endorsement."
Zubin Mehta,Amazon,"Highly accurate. Very useful and a must for anyone who wants to do intermittent fasting, diabetes reduction, weight loss and fitness."
N/A,Amazon,I have completed 15 days and now I have a fairly good idea what I should avoid eating to avoid a spike in my sugar level.Firstly the readings are not matching with the blood sugar monitor. I had a difference of more tha 20 each time I compared with my blood monitor. Even after trying to sync the machine it did not get corrected.Would have given 5 stars if it was more accurate and reasonably priced.
Umesh Sawant,Amazon,"Received package on 31st March 2024 with Freestyle Libre sensor package reading expiry of March 2024 rendering it useless to install.Being non-returnable, this is a reportable malpractice.Hope Ultraguman takes note of the same."
Yash,Amazon,"First time user of this magical device. It is a must try for any person if one is interested to know about the cycles and energy levels of one's body.I tried it during fasting, normal days, workouts and it has made me understand what makes me tired in the morning when I wake up, what meal causes lethargy and why.It is a total gamechanger. Kudos to the team for developing such an amazing product. Must try"
Threesixty,Amazon,Sensor cartridge already in fired position out of the box. With this you can’t connect the applicator properly (note the grey cartridge is at the bottom of the white cartridge).Note: Not ultrahumans problem. They shipped a perfectly fine Abbott Freestyle Libre box. They have a return envelope included for faulty etc sensors and will replace it.
Ms Patel,Amazon,"Hi.We have used ultra human before . But this time , it arrived a day before and we installed the sensor last night .Today it seems not to work .How do. We go about this . There are other unopened packs ."
Aniruddha,Amazon,"Been using Ultrahuman app for checking glucose spikes and overall health. App is really informative with notifications and also tracking food metrics. Have realised that fever and weakness has so much effect on glucose and metabolism. After 10 days, I was able to control glucose spikes with a daily routine and discipline.Really recommend trying this tracker once to see how your body reacts to different foods"
Yogesh,Amazon,This is very amazing product. I am using this since last 10 days. Providing accurate and continuous reading of glucose in my blood as per food intake and exercise I do. Thanks for such nice product
N/A,Amazon,"I have known for a long time that it was not good to consume a lot of simple sugars & carbs, but there is no perfect way to see the actual impact of consuming them. Ultrahuman M1 helped me realize how I was indulging in mindless big meal portions and drinking tea throughout my life. Food Score was a real game changer that helped me to reduce 2-3 cups of tea daily, cut my chapati portions, make me walk post-meal & have an early dinner. I have also learned why I was not productive throughout the day due to multiple glucose spikes & crashes. Anybody who wants to understand their food choices & lifestyle, don't think twice and just go for it. Learn, modify behaviors and reassess is my Mantra."
PRATEEK SARAN,Amazon,"The experience using CGM was quite smooth and revealing. The app crashes a bit, but the content is extremely good!Overall knowing the glucose spikes and crashes and the activities, food causing it is helping in conditioning my mind to move away and change."
Daniel,Amazon,The sensor did not work . It showed the same lower value twice in the morning while a test with one touch showed different values.and when I tried scanning again at 12 it asked me to change the sensor . Terribly disappointed that at this price point such defective products are shipped to customers.
Anonymous92,Amazon,"The Ultrahuman Continuous Glucose Monitor has been a game-changer for me. It helps me manage my food choices, portion sizes, and cravings by providing real-time glucose data and these super relevant metabolic scores. It motivates me to be more active by showing the immediate impact on my levels. This device has significantly improved my energy levels and overall well-being. Highly recommended!"
Manasvi,Amazon,"The kind of data you can get from Ultrahuman CGM is mind blowing. You get deep insights into your metabolism, fuel zones, spikes and crashes, problematic food groups, optimising your meals, real time nudges to take actions and much more.If you want some phenomenal data around your metabolism, this is it. Value for money! Go for it!"
Ankit,Amazon,"For me its one of the best biohacking tool I have used. Not only to keep you healthy, but also to transform into a ultrahuman. Although in every eight hours you have to scan it for readings. But once you start getting results, its worth it. Anyone who wants to dedicate themselves for betterself must have it."
Rajesh Kumar,Amazon,Track your glucose graph with +/- ( 20-30 ) from glucometer reading. But you can calliberate with glucometer reading.
magrathean,Amazon,"This includes a Libre CGM sensor. ""Ultrahuman M1"" is a sticker worth INR 10 on top of this and a free mobile app which reads the NFC CGM. This app reads the glucose level (and the Heart Rate, HRV, if you allow) and comes up with a ""metabolic score"" - which makes no sense whatsoever.""Ultrahuman"", ""Cyborg"" - all nice hype and gimmick. No mention of Libre Sensor anywhere in their product. You get know when you open the box!One would be better off to get a CGM at lower price and use the rest of the metrics in Apple Health, or Fitbit/Garmin Apps and track more useful health data. There are other free apps to read the glucose levels from the CGM, don't really need a separate reader that Abbot sells as well."
Prateek Kumar,Amazon,"Can’t believe that just by tracking glucose levels, we can get insights into sleep, food, exercise and overall lifestyle.They have basically gamified health and made it easy for a normal individual to understand what’s happening in our bodies.To top it off they have additional features like skin temperature, productivity music, metabolic education sections and amazing podcasts on the App itself.The experience has been totally worth it and i would recommend everyone reading this to try it. (Also the sensor application is completely painless so no need to worry about that)"
Aniiket S Sengar,Amazon,"I ordered the M1 from Amazon because it is cheaper than the Ultrahuman website listing. The actual sensor is Abott Libre, and the Ultrahuman app connects to it to show you cool insights about your Blood Glucose levels.I've been able to understand how exercise and meals affect my glucose levels and have been able to control and manage them over the week.Would recommend this to anyone looking to increase their metabolic performance or fending off Prediabetes or T2 Diabetes."
Jackson Jacob,Amazon,"Compared the readings of cgm with prick test after 2 days of installation/application of cgm to give it time to adjust to body.Not a single reading matched over first 5 days of ownership/use. If we had relied on this cgm readings & adjusted insulin, we'd have lost our life or be in coma. Way too scary.Reached out to Amazon for refund. They asked to mail the Ultrahuman office. And they are yet to respond/refuns.Waste of money. More importantly, risk to life."
Arun G.,Amazon,"The product is good and does what it is made to do, though reading differ when compared to a glucometer but then that is already mentioned by the mfr. It gave a lot of insight on as to what food is good and what not for me. However could not download data to show to my doctor. Will recommend for diabetics."
Vicky Shoor,Amazon,"Amazing product, must try it once. Good accurate result and app is amazing and easy to use."
MP,Amazon,"Honestly, the coolest thing was the tips from the performance coaches on beating my sweet cravings – total game-changer for me! Seeing how it connected with my readings and helped me tweak my diet was gold. Im definitely going to repurchase!!"
Ultrahuman,Amazon,I brought this item and same day I complaint of its non - working with all the proofs but neither they replace the item nor they refund this. It is very costly product and I feel cheated and highly disappointed by this Amazon company for not helping me in this regard. So think before to buy. Be cautious company cheated by sending defective items. And says thhey have non refundable policy. So how much they earn by doing this type this fraud .
NZR,Amazon,"You saved me, the best health product ever had"
N/A,Amazon,Poor quality assurance. Meant to have 3 sensors and one was in the box. Fleecing people through corrupt means. Also it’s the older version of the sensor - buy direct from Abbots.
Harshal Kulkarni,Amazon,It is not mentioned any where that we need NFC support mobile.
Surya Prakash,Amazon,Very good product. This cgm device helped me understand my diet and workout better. Glucose is a very important biomarker and indicates your health in a detailed manner. This app helps me check my glucose levels 24*7.
Anton Kovalev,Amazon,"I’ve been waiting for it for soooo long.Clear graph, simple installation, detailed readings. Last 15 mins every minute and earlier every 15 minutes"
Praful,Amazon,Great tech to monitor your own intake of varieties of food…
Sorab,Amazon,The sensor doesn’t work. I’ve tried taking a glucose reading all day and it keeps showing a reading of 45 mg/dL even though I’m diabetic. Complete fraud
dheeraj,Amazon,"Very costlier, common man cannot affort it plus this is not ultrahuman product, they have collaborated with freestyle libre. Its better to use test strips provided by control D they are cheap and more accurate than this"
pradip kadam,Amazon,"Good product,Easy to apply,U have to calibrate Bsl level with glucometer"
shantanu,Amazon,excellent product
amit saboji,Amazon,Not useful at all. Not at all close to actual blood sugar levels. There is a difference of more than 10 to 25 mg/dl. That’s according to me a lot. Not at all useful for medical purposes.
Narendra Kumar Arora,Amazon,"I paid for 4 sensors, but I received only one sensor."
VG,Amazon,"Avoid buying this. While the payment is for 2 CGMs, I received only one CGM."
Samrudha S.,Amazon,"This are old senors.. the latest one are freestyle libre 3, which costs the same."
Goutham SV,Amazon,"Have used this for my dad and this gives you great insights of metoballic health, simple tips but timely ones often helps us to make the course correction during the day to bring the levels under control, overall a great product for people who are working towards controlling their glucose levels."
N/A,Amazon,"The reliability of this product may/may not be good. Moreover, if any products have to be a success, they don't have to be very expensive just like the English used on their website. People can get results from a smart watch or blood sugar checking machine. These companies are established by the ultra rich ""Americans"" and caters to a meagre minority present in india. There are tremendous successful products established by the IITians/NITians/tier 1 colleges. My English may not be as good as the founders/staff of the company. But speaking top notch English doesn't relate to success. It related to a mirage of success."
N/A,Amazon,"This sensor is available at half the price on other websites. Just search for it and you will find it. Plus, this is not for people without diabetes. It’s specially suited for those with type 1 Diabetes who need extra monitoring. I am a juvenile diabetic since the age of 12. I used the sensor for 2 years in the UK, and bought this straight from the original manufacturer which is Abbott. This is a marketing gimmick from Ultrahuman who seem to not care about the buyer’s money or disorders. They are selling it like it’s their own invention. The only thing that is their own creation - is the black sticker with their branding - for which I must say - the sticking capability of the sticker is great! Except that, it’s not even their own product that they are selling."
Tamge,Amazon,"Have been using for 6 months now. Lost 5 kgs with the help of Ultrahuman M1. Premium brand, love it"
Radhika singh,Amazon,"The App data is very accurate and so effective, started using this since a day and i am loving it. Had bought this from the Ultrahuman website and its DIY"
Athif,Amazon,"Ultrahuman is my go to guide for nutrition, workout timings and helps me eat my food the right way. Performance coaches break down strategies and focus on improving my metabolic health."
Vivek,Amazon,The needle was broken when the package was opened. Unable to use product. Please help me to replace the broken needle.
Alka Hingorani,Amazon,"I wanted to like this product. I ended up disliking it immensely.1. It is inaccurate. My piece showed 20 points lower than what an Accucheck blood sugar monitor does. It asks you to calibrate the levels against an external reference. What's the point of spending so much if every sensor needs to be calibrated. (btw, the Accucheck showed the same reading as a reputed diagnostic lab)2. It is wildly misleading. It says that the normal range is 70-110 at *all times*, which is WRONG. It is well known that this range is considered normal when one has been fasting (12 or more hours since the last meal). Once you have eaten something, the sugar will go up, which is absolutely ok, as long as it settles down to 140 or below two hours later. To simplify, a normal person would have less than 110 on waking up, and less than 140 two hours after a big meal. The M1 starts screaming anytime the level is more than 110, which makes NO sense at all. I pointed this out to their support and to the CEO/Founder, who sent me a bunch of research papers, none of which had anything to do with this basic error.3. The app allows you to annotate the graph with events such as meals, exercise, sleep etc. But it still has no clue about post-prandial sugar, which defeats a big reason for entering these details.4. It is expensive. The sensor costs Rs. 6000 for 14 days (1 day is taken in auto-calibration), after which you have to throw it. And each replacement will have to be newly calibrated (see point 1)5. The app interface looks slick at first sight, but is AWFUL; it is basically a clutter of advertisements. The opening screen shows the Ring; I was most confused until I learnt that they are hawking another product. You are constantly urged to subscribe for something or the other. One can enter food details, but it is very limited (compare to HealthifyMe). The list goes on.6. The packaging is gorgeous, but once unpacked, there are no directions about how to install it. The app, as I said, is useless. I finally had to rely on someone's youtube video.7. Having to change it every 15 days contributes a whole chunk of plastic to the landfill.The only good thing about this product is its slick marketing."
"	Consumer",Amazon,"So I got the Ultrahuman M1 to track my glucose readings (I am not Diabetic but its genetic so precautionary tracking).First of all you get a package with Freestyle Libre Pro (launched in 2016), alcohol wipes and some patches to protect the sensor. If you are for some reason not able to install it properly, they provide a mail letter to send for free replacement. This is a nice touch and removes the hesitation of first time installation.Installing was a bit weird cause when I was trying to push the applicator it was not working. Saw the video and read instructions and it said it should be easy push Eventually it did work after 10 mins of fiddling. Libre's competitor is Dexcom which has a button press apply which is much better.Now coming to how these things work, they work with interstitial fluid (which is fluid that surrounds the cells of the tissues below your skin). Now Glucose enters bloodstream first and then diffuses to interstitial glucose. This causes a lag between the actual glucose and what this reads. This can vary from 10 mins to an hour depending on individual to individual.Since Libre Pro was released in 2016, it is now ancient technology which has quite some lag. Imaging using a 2016 phone now. Abbott has released Libre 3 quite some back which has much better readings. The MRP mentioned on the sensor was Rs 2661.I was surprised by this since in Europe they give Libre 2 in Jan 2022. You can google Techcruch review to see this. Libre 3 was approved in May 2022 and they might be giving that sensor to Americans/Europeans now.Now it takes 8-24 hours to initialize, where it might give false reading. For me even after 24 hours the reading were too high and I compared it with Blood monitor and there was a significant difference of 20-30 mg/dL. It also thought the same and asked me to calibrate it. So you would need a blood glucometer to calibrate it otherwise readings will be way off.Reading wise it is not reliable and you need to check with glucometer regularly.Their app is a bit confusing and filled with their own advertisement so much that it can be difficult to find stuff that you want to see (in my case food review, glucose readings, etc.). Most other apps will show you the product you have at the home page and all data their. But not Ultrahuman. You will just see big bold adds of their products all over.Finally when you get to the page you need, you can enter food details, sleep details, activity details and be able to correlate to spike or crashes. This can help you identify foods that makes your glucose level rise significantly. There is also a ChatGPT integration (their words) that suggests you what you can do with the means.Overall I would suggest don't go with the product. It is overpriced for an inferior product. Instead go with Abbott Freestyle Libre 3 or Dexcom G7 directly and couple that with food logging in Healthifyme. You can get the job done at 50% of the cost. Slightly more effort but paying double for it is not worth it esp for outdated tech.There are also Healthifyme and one more company that offers this. I haven't checked them in detail out but the rates are same. Not sure which sensor they send.TLDR: Indians are given inferior 2016 tech against Europeans/Americans who get the latest. Overpriced with a cluttered ad full app. Not at all for diabetics as readings are not accurate and you need to calibrate."
Vikram Vaidya,Amazon,Tchnically very high quality
silvia m.,Amazon,"In the package there are 2 sensors but one of the two expired on February 10, 2024, the second expires in June 2025, I did not open it and I returned it"
Klaus,Amazon,The sensor or the product might be good. I can’t say - I am only using it for a day. But what everyone needs to know is: what you buy here is a sensor that will only work for 2 weeks. After that you need to buy a subscription that effectively coasts more than 2000€ per year. If you are prepared to do that I guess it’s fine to buy - otherwise don’t.
Hari Hemachandran,Amazon,I have type 2 diabetes and I always struggled to get my sugar low. Probably my best investment to buy these cgms.Now I know what I have been doing wrong and the app alerts at the right time to move or walk to get my sugar low.This is just my 1st week so far I can say it does what it states
Christian,Amazon,"Based on the title of the article, the buyer comments and the unboxing videos that can be found online, I assumed that there were two sensors. One was delivered. Generation 2. The FreeStyle Libre 3 can be purchased directly from the manufacturer, for significantly less money.In short: I felt like I was pulled over the counter and immediately returned the product. 105 euros for a 14-day sensor is simply too expensive.Otherwise: Everything is very nicely presented and certainly a cool device and an interesting app. So a second point."
